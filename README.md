# PyZelda

## About
Remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening built on top of a custom engine I wrote in Python. 
PyZelda is written in Python 2.7 as I had not yet switched to Python 3 when I wrote it. It is 
unfinished, but contains a large portion of the overworld, as well as many functional signs and text
boxes, and some enemies. PyZelda was mainly intended as an example game to test and demonstrate my
Python game engine and was never intended to be a full remake. I used PyGame for my windowing and 
rendering, and PyAudio for sound and music. I didn't use PyGame's sound modules because I had 
issues with them.

## Installation
```
python2 setup.py install
```
You may have to install Python2 PyGame for your distribution before installing PyZelda because
PyGame has some dependencies that cannot be installed through a standard python setup.
