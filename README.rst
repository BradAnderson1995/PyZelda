PyZelda
#######

About
=====
Remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening built on top of a custom engine I wrote in Python.

PyZelda is written in Python 2.7 as I had not yet switched to Python 3 when I wrote it. It is 
unfinished, but contains a large portion of the overworld, as well as many functional signs and text
boxes, and some enemies. PyZelda was mainly intended as an example game to test and demonstrate my
Python game engine and was never intended to be a full remake. You're free to do whatever you want
with PyZelda, and I'm no longer actively developing it.

I used PyGame for my windowing and rendering, and PyAudio for sound and music. I didn't use
PyGame's sound modules because I had issues with them.

Installation
============
You may have to install PyGame for Python 2 for your distribution before installing PyZelda because
PyGame has some dependencies that cannot be installed through a standard python setup.

PyZelda on Windows doesn't seem to work at this time and I haven't gotten around to getting it to
work yet. I'll probably do that at some point in the future, but for now it's best to run it on
Linux. If you want to try getting it to work on Windows, more power to you.
